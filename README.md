# Chip-8 Emulator

I began this project with the hopes of learning more about emulation. I wanted to start writing an NES emulator, but CHIP-8 seemed a little more friendly so I went with that. This project includes a lot of concepts I haven't dealt with directly before, so I'm learning a lot every step of the way. Especially since I've never used Java before this >_< ... At the time of writing, this project is nowhere close to done.

# Things I've learned along the way
##### Hexadecimal number system and bitwise operations
Makes a lot of intuitive sense; A lot of it is just recall and new application of concepts I learned in Digital Logic and Circuitry at TAMUC
#### Java
It's not too far removed from Python an C++, languages I know better, but it is definitely different. Interfaces are a new concept and seem extremely useful. I would imagine this is my first true taste of OOP since Java is a more focused language.
#### Maven
 So far, it seems like a far more sophisticated build tool than Makefile. I have a suspicion that I will only be needing the basics of Maven for this project.
