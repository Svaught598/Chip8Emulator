# Chip-8 Emulator

Just a CHIP-8 Emulator! Built with Java & Swing, project undertaken to learn about system emulation.

# Motivation

Since I found out about system emulation, I have been super fascinated with it. I'm building this CHIP-8 emulator (interpreter...?) to get started since the EmuDev community tends to suggest it for first-timers. I don't have a ton of programming experience, and never used Java before, so I thought it would be a good idea to learn that as well! I Plan on compiling useful tips for CHIP-8 Emulation soon.

# Screenshots

Coming soon!

# Technology Used

- Java
- Swing Framework (not really sure if it counts)
- Maven
- JUnit 

# Features

The goal is to be fully compatible with all known implementations of CHIP-8 instructions (using a menu with different "Modes"). Right now, the emulator is still has a few problems with interpretting opcodes, so the current feature list is:
- Panel to view register values
- Panel to view current CPU instruction
- Panel to look at other stuff (ROM title, buttons, etc...)

# Testing

Since most of the application is GUI, unit tests have only been written for the CPU. There are a number of test roms to facilitate debugging, so the unit tests weren't super rigorous; the test roms are included in the roms folder.

# Installation

Coming soon!
